## Overview

`PatchDiff-AI` is a Python-based, LangGraph-driven **multi-agent** system that **automates large-scale reverse-engineering**. Feed it a plain-text list of CVE identifiers, and it **spawns** a supervised multi-agent graph that decompiles the vulnerable component, correlates patched **and** unpatched binaries with BinDiff 8, and **generates** a detailed report for each vulnerability.

* **Parallel by default** – every CVE runs in its own instance of the graph.  
* **Deterministic supervision** – the top-level *Supervisor* node coordinates tool errors and time-outs so rogue sub-agents cannot derail the batch.  
* **Extensible** – new analysis stages are a single node away (see [Extending the Graph](#extending-the-graph)).

> [!NOTE]
> **Supported OS: Windows only.** The system targets Microsoft Patch Tuesday updates, but contributors are welcome to extend it to other platforms (e.g., Android) or specific applications. It currently analyzes only CVEs that affect the host OS version.<br>
> **Tested on: Windows 11 24H2 x64**; other versions *should* work.

> [!WARNING]  
> This project uses `chromadb`, which **has** a known crashing issue on some setups. If you **encounter** *Process finished with exit code -1073741819 (0xC0000005)*, the fault lies in `chromadb`/`HNSWlib`. Switch the virtual-machine engine or use a physical machine.

## Architecture

![Supervisor.png](rsrc/arch.png)

Each **Agent** is a subgraph and operates independently. Anyone can extend the system easily by containing the changes to the relevant graph.

## Installation

### 4.1 Python 3.11

Download *Windows x64* installer from [https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3119/](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3119/). During setup **enable “Add to PATH”** and **“Install for all users”**.

```powershell
python --version  # should print 3.11.x
```

### 4.2 IDA Pro 8.x or 9.x

1. Purchase / download IDA Pro from Hex‑Rays. Either track works:
   * **IDA Pro 8.x** – default install `C:\Program Files\IDA Pro 8.x`, headless
     binary is `idat64.exe`.
   * **IDA Professional 9.x** – default install
     `C:\Program Files\IDA Professional 9.x`. The separate `idat`/`idat64`
     binaries were removed; the unified `ida.exe` runs headless when launched
     with `-A`. idalib is bundled.
2. Run the installer and keep the default location, or point the tool at a
   custom install by setting `IDA_PATH` to the absolute path of the headless
   binary, e.g.:

   ```powershell
   > setx IDA_PATH "C:\Program Files\IDA Professional 9.3\ida.exe"
   ```

   If `IDA_PATH` is unset, the tool auto-probes the usual 9.x and 8.x install
   roots in that order and uses the first match.
3. Verify IDA has access to Python. If the GUI shell cannot `import` Python
   modules, run `idapyswitch` as admin:

   ```powershell
   > "<IDA install dir>\idapyswitch.exe"
   ```

### 4.3 BinExport + BinDiff

1. Download the BinDiff release matching your IDA major version from
   Google Security Research (BinDiff 8 for IDA 8.x, BinDiff 9 for IDA 9.x).
2. Validate the plugin DLLs under `%APPDATA%\Hex-Rays\IDA Pro\plugins` (or the
   per-user plugins folder for IDA Professional 9.x):
   * `bindiff<ver>_ida*.dll`
   * `binexport12_ida*.dll`
3. Restart IDA once to verify `Edit → Plugins → BinExport` is present.

### 4.4 IDA Pro MCP (headless idalib)

The Reverse-Engineering flow no longer decompiles every BinDiff-flagged function up-front. Instead, after BinDiff finishes, the supervisor spawns **two headless `idalib-mcp` servers** (one per binary) and hands the worklist to an agent that pulls pseudocode on demand over SSE.

1. Make sure **idalib** is available for your IDA install. It is bundled with
   IDA 9.x; for 8.x consult Hex-Rays for the compatibility layer. idalib
   typically needs to be initialised once so it can locate the IDA install:

   ```powershell
   > python -m idapro --configure
   ```

   (or follow the Hex-Rays idalib README for your IDA version).
2. Install the CLI that hosts idalib over MCP:

   ```powershell
   > pip install ida-pro-mcp
   ```

   This lands the `idalib-mcp` binary on `PATH`. Verify:

   ```powershell
   > idalib-mcp --help
   ```

3. Environment knobs:

   | Var                    | Default        | Purpose                                          |
   |------------------------|----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
   | `IDA_PATH`             | autodetected   | Full path to `ida.exe` (9.x) or `idat64.exe` (8.x). |
   | `IDALIB_MCP_BIN`       | `idalib-mcp`   | Override the launcher binary (absolute path ok). |
   | `IDA_MCP_PORT_BASE`    | `8745`         | Primary server port; secondary uses `+1`.        |
   | `IDA_MCP_BOOT_TIMEOUT` | `60` (seconds) | How long to wait for each port to open.          |

> [!NOTE]
> The launcher always passes `--isolated-contexts`, so the two idalib sessions can run side-by-side safely. If `idalib-mcp` is missing from `PATH`, or a port fails to open within the boot timeout, the run aborts — there is no batch-decompile fallback.

### 4.5 Project dependencies

```powershell
# clone
> git clone <this repo>
> cd patchdiff_ai

# isolate
> python -m venv .venv
> .venv\Scripts\activate

# compile deps (langgraph, python-bindiff, ida-pro-mcp, etc.)
> pip install -r requirements.txt
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------
CVE-2025-32713 Report
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Detailed Root Cause Analysis
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The caller supplies a _CLFS_READ_BUFFER structure (a5) which contains
an address returned through _CLFS_READ_BUFFER::GetAddress().  The size
of this heap buffer is passed separately in parameter a6.

Inside ReadLogBlock() the driver iterates over the log file and fills
the caller’s buffer in chunks.  The following variables control the
copy size per iteration:
  v24 / v25      – overall request length (from a6)
  *a10           – running count of bytes already written
  v27 (renamed v28 in patch) – *current* chunk size to copy
  v48            – physical sector / log page size fetched from the
                    on-disk log header

Pre-patch logic derives v27 like this:
  v27 = v24 - *a10;               // remaining caller space
  if(first_iteration && (a4 & 1)) // header request
        v27 = v48;                // **force log-page size**
After that, without any further validation, either
  • CClfsLogFcbPhysical::ReadLog() (for packed logs)   or
  • CcCopyRead() (for cached logs)
writes v27 bytes to the buffer pointed to by v51.

If v27 is larger than the remaining space (a6-*a10) the write overruns
the heap allocation supplied by user land, corrupting adjacent kernel
heap memory.  An attacker can reach this state by:
  1. Supplying a deliberately small read buffer (a6)
  2. Crafting a log file whose page size (v48) is larger than the
     provided buffer and by requesting header mode (a4==1).
The lack of an alignment check (v27 %% v48) and of a final bounds test
(v27 <= a6-*a10) constitutes the exact defect.

Once corrupted, the CLFS heap block resides in kernel address space;
controlled data written past the end can be used to change function
pointers or object headers, allowing privileged code execution.

Vulnerability Code Snippets
--------------------------------------------------------------------
\```c
// pre-patch: chunk size forced to page size without bounds check
if ((v73 & 1) && !*a10) {
    v27 = v48;          // page size from log header
    v47 = v48;
}
...
CcCopyRead(a2, &FileOffset, v27, 1u, v51, &IoStatus); // overflow

// patch: abort if misaligned and additional size sanity check
if (FeatureFlag() && v28 % v48) {
    v12 = STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER;
    ...
}
...
if (FeatureFlag()) {
    if (FileOffset.QuadPart < 0 ||
        v32 - *a10 < v28 ||                // new bound check
        RtlLongLongAdd(...) < 0 ||
        NewEnd > MaxLogSize) {
        v12 = STATUS_LOG_CORRUPTION;
    }
}
\```

Trigger Flow (Top-Down)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
User mode               -> nt!NtReadFile on a CLFS log stream
FS miniredirector       -> clfs!CClfsClientReadLogRecord()
clfs.sys                -> CClfsLogFcbPhysical::ReadLogBlock()
  └── computes v27               (faulty)
  └── calls CcCopyRead()/ReadLog  (overflow occurs)

Attack Vector
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Local, authenticated attacker creates or opens a writable CLFS log,
submits a small read buffer to ClfsReadLogRecord() (or similar), and
crafts the log header so that the page size (v48) exceeds the supplied
buffer.  The subsequent kernel copy overruns heap memory, enabling
privilege escalation.

## Extending the Graph

The decision for using Langgraph was to provide an extensible architecture where anyone that is familiar with it could <br>
contribute with ease. Langgraph has advantages but also disadvantages like stability, steep learning curve, and<br>
over-abstraction.

This tool is just the tip of the iceberg in what can be done using LLMs for vulnerability assessments and analysis.<br>
The next steps that should be taken are:
1. Implement `ReAct` to the refinement process
2. Gather multiple CVEs with the same source file for correlation analysis
3. Improve memory usage
4. Create better heuristics upon the bindiff reults
5. Include call flow for heuristics as well as for LLM context
6. Add Ghidra support
7. Use Windows installation images as base winsxs sources
8. Port the code to run on Unix systems
9. Add MCP interfaces to the various agents
10. Use the function vectorstore to identify semantically related code and logics to find 0-days with CVE as reference
11. The list is too long... take a moment and contribute

As for the code practice and quality, improvement and suggestions are welcome.
